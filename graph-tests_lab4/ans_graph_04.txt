1. Graph is undirected.

2. deg = [3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2].

Graph is not connected
3. Connected components:
[3, 4, 10]
[6]
[8]
[1, 2, 5, 7, 9]

6. D = +Infinity	 Z = [10, 3, 4, 1, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 8]
   R = +Infinity	 P = [10, 3, 4, 1, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 8]

7. Distancies and shortest paths.
from 1 to 10
no path (+Infinity)
from 9 to 2
path 9-5-2 (53)
from 10 to 6
no path (+Infinity)
from 2 to 8
