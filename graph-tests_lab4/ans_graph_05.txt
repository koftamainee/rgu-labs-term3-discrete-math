1. Graph is directed.

2. deg_in = [5, 4, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 7, 2]
   deg_out = [4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 4, 3].

Digraph is connected
4. Weakly connected components:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

5. Strongly connected components:
[12, 6, 2, 9, 11, 1, 10, 5, 3, 8, 4, 7]

7. Distancies and shortest paths.
