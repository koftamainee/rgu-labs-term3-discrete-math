1. Graph is undirected.

2. deg = [4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 9, 8, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 5].

Graph is not connected
3. Connected components:
[1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15]
[2, 3, 4, 8, 12]

6. D = +Infinity	 Z = [4, 2, 8, 3, 12, 10, 7, 13, 15, 9, 14, 1, 5, 11, 6]
   R = +Infinity	 P = [4, 2, 8, 3, 12, 10, 7, 13, 15, 9, 14, 1, 5, 11, 6]

7. Distancies and shortest paths.
