1. Graph is undirected.

2. deg = [5, 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5].

Graph is not connected
3. Connected components:
[2, 5]
[1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]

6. D = +Infinity	 Z = [2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 4, 8, 7]
   R = +Infinity	 P = [2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 4, 8, 7]

7. Distancies and shortest paths.
from 1 to 8
path 1-7-8 (32)
from 6 to 5
no path (+Infinity)
from 7 to 6
path 7-8-6 (29)
from 5 to 1
no path (+Infinity)
