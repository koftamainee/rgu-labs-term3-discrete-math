1. Graph is directed.

2. deg_in = [5, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 3]
   deg_out = [4, 3, 3, 5, 5, 3, 5, 4, 3, 6, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 2, 2, 4, 0, 5, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3].

Digraph is not connected
4. Weakly connected components:

[1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24]

5. Strongly connected components:
[2, 6, 22, 3, 23, 12, 25, 18, 16]
[19]
[20, 24, 11, 8, 4, 1, 14, 10, 13, 9, 5, 21, 7, 17, 15]
